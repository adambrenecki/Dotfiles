Dotfiles
========

These are my `dotfiles <http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/>`_, configuration files for software I use. I'm sharing them here just in case they happen to be useful to someone else.

``bash/csem_local.sh``

Provides a number of Bash shortcuts for students using the computer systems at the School of Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics, Flinders University. For installation and usage, see the comments at the top of that file.
